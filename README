Workflow: Init
gitri init <url> [dir] [version]

gitri checkout <revset>

Workflow: Track server changes
gitri update

Workflow: Create a new revset to work a ticket
gitri revset <new_revset> [source_revset]
	(creates a new branch in manifest)
[develop]
[use git to commit locally, change branches, etc.]
gitri add [-h|--hash|-b|--branch] <repo names>
	(update local manifest file)
gitri push
	(commit local manifest file, push all repo branches and manifest branch)

Nomenclature:
repository: a git (or other VCS) repository.  repo is accepted shorthand.
project: A collection of repos in a specified layout.  A project is defined by a manifest repo.
revset: A set of revisions of the repositories in a project.  They are named by the branch of the manifest repo in which they are stored.

Porcelain Commands:
init: checkout a new gitri project
update: update all repos with upstream updates (fetch followed by ?resetish command?)
checkout: checkout another revset
revset: create a new revset
add: add a repos branch or commit to the local manifest file
push: push repo changes to servers (commit (manifest) followed by repo-push and manifest-push)
status: print status of all repos (--deep option for internal status)

Plumbing Commands:
fetch:
commit:

Future Commands:
reset: reset a subset of repos to the proper gitri branch
merge: merge repos of other revsets into current one

TODO:
print git output

Project Layout:
The .gitri folder in the main repo contains the manifest repo.
On init, for each project in the repo, a branch called gitri/<revset>/<remote>/<branch> is created and checked out.
A more detailed branch name is required because there may be branches with the same name from different revsets, and remotes.
Current philosophy is that development from different revsets with the same branches, should be separate.
